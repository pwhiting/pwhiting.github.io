This morning we woke up and left our Airbnb by 9:15. We rode until about 3:15. It was amazing to think that last year we rode yesterday‘s ride and today’s ride all in one day. We were plenty tired arriving today and grateful we didn’t have another 50 miles to go.

We both slept well last night. It was the first time we had an air conditioner in our Airbnb. The husband and wife who run the Airbnb are involved with heating and air conditioning professionally. We thought about not using it, as we’ve become somewhat acclimated, but in the end, why suffer?

Today’s ride was uneventful. We saw many things that we remembered from last year‘s ride, including a few bathrooms… There was one point in today’s ride were transitioned from a slow steady climb to a slow, steady descent. It was like the magic halfway point. I couldn’t figure out if we were tired or if our bike was having problems for the first half of the day, but hitting the peak and starting to go downhill help me realize gravity was at fault.

We arrived early, which worked out well for me, as they had a swimming pool for me to cool off in. We had planned to walk to a small supermarket about a mile away to purchase groceries for tonight and tomorrow. But one of our hosts insisted on driving us to a large supermarket quite a bit further away. As we normally do, we bought 9 L of juice, chocolate, soy milk, and Perrier. We were shopping hungry, so we kind of overbought. It will be interesting to see if we can finish everything we purchased before we leave on Monday. As I was carrying the groceries from our host car to our Airbnb and noting how heavy they were, I was so grateful that he had offered to drive us. He took an hour out of his life and saved us both one or more hours.

We are now relaxing in the Airbnb. I need to figure out when church is tomorrow. I chose this Airbnb because it was very close to our meeting house. It is only a block or two away.
