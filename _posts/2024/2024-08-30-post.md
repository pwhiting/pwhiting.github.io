We are writing in Friday morning, the day after arriving in Geneva. Our flights worked out well. We left our home at about 11 and drove to Bryan’s office (newly remodeled and expanded – bet nice!) and he drove with us to the airport and then drove our truck home (thanks Bryan!) Our flight to Paris was delayed by 30 minutes, but we had plenty of time on our layover in Paris to get on our flight to Switzerland. Neither of us slept very well on the airplane but both of us were able to doze off several times. Our flight to Geneva was delayed by about an hour. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, but I had set up our ride plan with an airbnb about 30 miles away from the airport. Our late arrival shifted our arrival time at our Airbnb.

Our bike made it to Geneva with us! One of the bike boxes was completely open. I can’t tell if I had done a poor job taping the bottom or if someone along the way had opened it and not taped it shut. (There was an inspection tag in each box.) I had learned after our first trip to not put a lot of loose parts in the boxes. This bike box had the rear half of our bike, a wheel, a seat, and the seat pad. In hindsight, I should’ve bound them all together so that either they all make it or nothing makes it. Had the wheel or seat fallen out in the Paris transfer, our bike ride would’ve been canceled because I doubt they would’ve been able to figure out where it went. Both the wheel and seat are unique enough that getting replacements would take months. We are grateful that worked out and will adjust that aspect of our packing for future trips.

The other box was in better shape but had a large hole in it. A very small part of the front hub (size of 2-3 popcorn kennels)  has been wedged off somehow in transit. Gratefully, it hadn’t fallen out of the hole and Natalie noticed it. I was able to get it reinstalled on the front hub, which was important to us because our front hub provides power for our headlight. And our headlight was necessary because we would be riding in the dark to our Airbnb.

Assembling the bike took about two hours as usual. There were several things that went faster, but a few things that took longer. Given our late arrival we weren’t riding until after 6 PM. Leaving Geneva airport was a much better bike path experience than leaving Charles de Gaulle airport last year (and that's an understatement). We had marked bike lanes all the way out of the core of Geneva. We had one routing error early on, due to construction. We took the marked detour, but it ended up taking us in the opposite direction that we wanted to ride. It probably added 20 to 30 minutes to an already tight schedule.

Leaving a little after 6 PM, we had a little less than four hours to make the 30 miles which would’ve been normally quite doable. However, we were riding with an extra heavy bike due to the panniers and we had a lot of hills even though the net was going to be elevation loss. We make our best time when the road is flat. When we ride uphill and downhill, our average speed is typically less than riding on the flat because the uphill is so slow. 

We had messaged our Airbnb host and realized there was a 10 PM cut off for our arrival. So we had a little extra pressure because we were riding against a deadline. Had we arrived late I think we could’ve figured something out with the host, perhaps paying extra. This particular Airbnb was a room in a shared house, and I can see how it would be very inconvenient for guests to show up really late. So even though in my calm mind today, I can see how it would’ve worked out, we were riding as if we were going to be sleeping on the side of the road if we didn’t make it by 10 PM. We didn't take any breaks and we pedaled as hard as we could up the hills. We arrived at the Airbnb at 9:30, with a half hour to spare, but very tired.

A portion of the ride was in the dark. Gratefully our headlight worked, but something isn’t working with our tail light. So we were a little bit nervous about cars being able to see us. Gratefully we have good reflectors on our panniers and Natalie had a flashing light on the back of her helmet. Also gratefully, the drivers in Geneva seem to be extra aware of bike riders. They would generally slow down quite a bit prior to passing us. Several times cars entering the road waited for us to pass. This is not our experience in the United States, where automobiles tend to have the right of way regardless of the situation.

Our Airbnb host was pleasant. We are so grateful that we get a breakfast here because with all the rushing we didn’t get to eat a meal in the evening yesterday. We had planned to stop and buy something at a store, but ran out of time, so last night’s dinner was a granola bar and lots of water.

We both slept well and are looking forward to breakfast and a more peaceful ride today. We have about 60 miles to cover.
