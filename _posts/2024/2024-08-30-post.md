We slept moderately well last night. You’d think, as exhausted as we were, we would have slept soundly, but we’re off by about eight hours on our circadian rhythm and even melatonin couldn’t make up the difference. But we were both grateful for the sleep we got. So much better than how we would have slept had we not made it to our Airbnb.

Our Airbnb host provided breakfast, which was appreciated as we hadn’t been able to shop for food last night. We ate bread with butter and jam and a sweet bread that was mostly like cake. I think we could’ve handled a more substantial breakfast, but it was what was provided and we were grateful.

We left at about 10 and rode until about 6, with a one-hour break for lunch. We started tired and rode tired. On these trips it usually takes two or three days for our bodies to start getting used to the routine.

Lunch service was slow but the food tasted so good. We found a restaurant which was on our ride path. A kind but chatty fellow tour biker was very interested in our bike. We were so tired, I think without the good meal we would have struggled. The cafe was also in a beautiful spot looking out on a lake and mountain.

Today’s ride was mostly bike path. It is so peaceful to ride on a bike path. There were a few places where there was a dirt road next to our paved path. That is very common in Europe and seems to be the opposite of what happens in the United States where we would pave the road first and then maybe a bike path. It shows Europe’s commitment to biking as an important form of transportation.

At about our midway point, we came across a lake with a pebbly beach. The water looked quite dirty, but I knew I could use a cool down plunge. Normally on our bike rides, when we’re trying to get 80 to 100 miles in a day, we don’t have time for such frivolous play. Not this time. I jumped in the water and felt so much better. It's pretty hot and humid. We hope as time goes the weather will cool down, bit time will tell.

We bought some food at a grocery store near our Airbnb and arrived right at six, which was the earliest they would allow us to check in. Our room is nice but very small. It’s wonderful to have our own bathroom and tiny yet functional kitchen
. Many if not most here in Europe don’t seem to have air conditioning. So we are sleeping on top of our sheets again with a fan blowing on us.

Tomorrow’s ride should be quite similar to today’s. We might try to leave a little bit earlier so that we can finish up as the temperature peaks.

This is exactly what we signed up for. This is our 7th big bike trip, and we have learned over the years that the destinations are not as important as where you are riding all day. We have found we love the bike paths so much, especially the Eurovelo routes.
