We slept well. The cooler weather helps, as does a comfortable (firm) bed. 

We woke up, ate breakfast, and walked 3 miles to church. Google Maps took us on a few dead end paths, so eventually I created a route using our bike routing software. It took us just over an hour due to our backtracking. The route involved crossing under a few major roadways and railroad tracks and cutting through Sunday-abandoned industrial parking lots. As we arrived at church the man from Ukraine we met yesterday arrived with his wife. They were very welcoming.

The ward was very diverse, with many nationalities and languages represented. They had headsets and an English interpreter, so I was able to keep track of what was being said.

At the end of church the Ukrainian family invited us to dinner tonight. It was so kind of them! We are both feeling exhausted and had all of our food arranged for today, so we did our best to express sincere gratitude for their invitation even though we were turning it down. I think they understood and we were able to chat for about 15 minutes. It is hard to explain how much we value our peaceful down time when our normal days are filled with physical exertion.

We walked home. It was a bit faster as we didn’t have to backtrack. We talked about how, on these trips, we grow comfortable with navigating through places we normally would not go. Not that they are unsafe, just relatively complex routes though industrial parts of cities not frequented by pedestrians.

We bought a few things at the bakery near our home (so that we could have dessert with dinner) and made it home by about 1:30. We made and ate dinner, and filled the rest of our time reading, talking, and relaxing.

On the way home we noticed for the first time the view of the mountains from our Airbnb. They are beautiful.

Tomorrow we ride to Geneva and begin the process of packing up to fly home.
