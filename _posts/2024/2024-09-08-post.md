Last evening, we spent time with our hosts visiting on their back porch. They were so kind and welcoming. They shared with us a dessert she had made to celebrate her husband‘s retirement. We appreciate their kindness and hospitality. It was the second evening in a row where we disappointed our hosts by not being able to share their beer and wine. It is so kind of them to offer and we try hard to express our gratitude in a way that is meaningful. 

This morning we went to church. The ward we attended was less than a full block away from our house, perhaps similar distance to our current situation in Bluffdale. I had looked for this Airbnb with awareness of where the meeting house was in this area. It’s rare that we find one so close.

I enjoy how familiar church feels, even when I can’t understand what is being said. The music is familiar, but it is something deeper too. It just feels familiar.

After church we returned "home" and just rested. I hosed off the bike, which was quite grimy after 1.5 weeks of riding. (Our Airbnb host had left me some rags and cleaner for it.)  It has been lightly raining on and off all day. The forecast shows rain in the coming days. Hopefully it will be light and intermittent instead of steady like we had on Thursday. I bet we had almost an inch of rain that day.

Our clothes are clean (thanks to a washing machine in this home) and dry (thanks to the sun into the evening yesterday). We are starting to get packed and organized for Monday’s ride to Burg.
