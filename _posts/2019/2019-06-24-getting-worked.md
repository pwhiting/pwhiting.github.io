I am completely worked. We rode 90 miles with only about 2000 vertical feet. I had thought we could do more, but I realized as we suffered through our last 20 miles that we have been sedentary for a week, not counting Sunday, and this is our longest ride this year and the first one with over a hundred pounds of gear strapped to our bike. That combined with 100 pounds of bike makes for a lot of mass to get up to speed.

Besides crashing into our Airbnb in Laxvik with full body shakes, here is how the rest of the day went. We rolled out from Kungsbacka around 9:00 a.m. and headed south down the western cost of Sweden. We stayed mostly on a bike trail labeled Kattegottleden 1. We chose to bypass several sections where the trail went out on peninsulas. We would have loved to have ridden there, but we felt like we needed to make up time. In hindsight, that might have been a bad idea. We have written in some amazingly beautiful places in this world. I think today's ride was the most beautiful and scenic we have been on anywhere. There was one section we rode through that we were just absorbing it and didn't even think to take pictures. If you are looking for an amazing bike ride, come to Sweden and ride Kattegottleden 1. You will not be disappointed. I wish we had given ourselves 2 or 3 days for this part of the ride.We arranged an Airbnb late in the day. There have been plenty of options. If the whole ride is like this we will regret bringing our tent and sleeping bags. So far the costs have been very affordable -- approaching the cost of a campsite fee. The one we are in now is delightful, 200 meters from the ocean (which we can see out the window) and costs about $50. The hosts are exceptional as well. We are very satisfied. We may find it hard to leave in the morning. For food we stopped along the way eating at a roadside fast food place (veggie burger, falafel, and lots of fries), ate at a supermarket (can of peaches, Gatorade, and grape juice) and finished off by going shopping prior to heading to our Airbnb. Tonight we had rice with frozen stirfry vegetables. It was perfect for me, as I was in poor condition to eat. After walking to the beach we finished the day with chocolate pudding (vegan) and hot chocolate made with chocolate oat milk. I realize things taste extra good after a day like today, but that stuff is awesome. The brand is Oatly, and I think it is available in the US. We hardly had the energy to blog, but we love recording our memories in an effort to preserve them.[embed-google-album src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4sWMsHzCWltCkQmvHJNZs0KmZdcJeA0wV4XecEwT7an8QT\_ODpNRiX4pqXcxsXMUlPcKOod8aFnJbrHZngxBSmpS29uJCEwPNldS3UTBMVqqXYmoTsVRLv7Cb3rMR-IJ\_\_SWSPvI42A" click="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rVMJZHqXz7wVMswv7" title="Ride to Laxvik"]![](https://ride.whitings.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screenshot_20190624-2353561332849541349633848.png)
