Today we took a much needed day of rest in Höfn. We moved from our hotel to a campground at noon and then attended a small local church with about 10 others. Siggi had contacted the pastor yesterday to find out the time they hold their service. In a town this small, everyone knows everyone. It is delightful.

I've been thinking about the drivers who pass us too fast and too close. I think an appropriate punishment for a crime like that would be to be sentenced to ride with me for an hour. They'd certainly gain a first-hand appreciation of the perils of biking with these narrow shoulders and I'd probably get a chance to know them better and understand why they are in such a hurry. We'd both win. Although Natalie might argue that being on a bike with me violates some human rights fundamental - it could be considered cruel and unusual punishment.

I'll include a photo of one of the horses here with their cool manes. It's like they share a barber with Shaggy from Scooby Doo.

Our campground was sparse at noon, but now at 8 pm it looks like what you would expect in Yellowstone. Natalie and I both like getting away from crowds, but we are happy to see so many people enjoying the beauty of this country.

Tomorrow should be a moderate day as far as miles and climbing go. The big unknown is the weather. Right now it appears we will be riding in light rain - if the weather matches the forecast. We're told that the forecast is always right but sometimes the weather is wrong.
