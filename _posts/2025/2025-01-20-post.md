Today we went to the beach… that is how every entry on this trip will start. We went to Playa Chiva … we arrived in the late morning and found a semi private location. Over time a few other groups showed up and we had a couple 25 yards to our east and another 25 yards to our west.

Natalie read her book while I sat there perplexed – what am I supposed to do? After a few hours I resolved never to go on a real vacation again and delay retirement until I’m 72.

In the afternoon we drove home, had dinner (bagels and quesadillas). Then we walked to another beach (Playa El Cocal) about 5 minutes from our home to watch the sun set.

Seriously, I don’t know how to do a trip like this.
