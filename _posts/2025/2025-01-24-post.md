Today was our last full day on Vieques. Per normal, we slept in, ate breakfast and headed to a beach. We went to the same one we went to last night (Playa La Plata, site 25). We got there early and had the pick of the entire beach. We set up in the very middle, in the sun. 

Shortly after we set up, an older couple came up and set up directly behind us in the palm trees. It wasn’t long before we realized we had missed the opportunity to be under natural shade. Our beach umbrella wasn’t going make it the entire day with the light breeze. As we sat there trying to decide where to move, another group walked by us and went to the far left side of the beach, where there were trees and shade. I found myself frustrated, wishing we had chosen one of these other spots. I think this is a common mental space for me to be in, constantly thinking about what could’ve been had I made different choices. I did it when we picked up our rental Jeep: for the next day I found myself wishing I had chosen the other of our two options. I do it when we rent an Airbnb, constantly second-guessing myself. I think when God tells us “thou shall not covet,” it isn’t because coveting makes Him sad, it’s because He knows it makes us sad. It’s like He’s saying “Pete, figure out how to be happy with what you’ve got.” So there I am, sitting on a beautiful beach in the Caribbean, with ocean waves breaking in front of me, warm sand under my feet, out of the cold front that has embraced Utah, frustrated, because I didn’t make the optimal beach selection choice when I arrived. I’m writing this down because I know it sounds ridiculous. Maybe that’s ultimately how I think through it.

One of the groups left, and we were able to go move into a better spot, one that provided us with adequate shade and a wind block. We stayed at this beach longer than any of the other beaches. The water was clear enough, warm enough, and sandy enough. There were very few other groups there. 

Around four, we drove over to the beach where Brent and Ann and family were, and spent some time with them. On our way back to our Airbnb, we stopped by their VRBO and were able to look at the views of the island it offers. (They will be here for another week and a half.)

We returned home, showered, and made a simple dinner with our leftover food. Tomorrow morning we check out and fly to San Juan (back on the main island of Puerto Rico) where we will spend the day prior to flying home first thing Sunday morning.

This has been an interesting vacation for me. I haven’t yet wrapped my brain around whether or not I will want to do another one like it. I’m grateful that Natalie puts up with me. Vacationing isn’t my strong suit.
