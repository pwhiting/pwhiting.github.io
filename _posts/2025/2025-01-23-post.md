The bioluminescent bay (Bio Bay)  last night was amazing. It’s one of those things that you can’t really get a picture of, and it is super hard to describe. Little microscopic organisms (dinoflagellates) light up like tiny fireflies when the water is disturbed. And there are hundreds of thousands of them per gallon of water, so as we paddled through the bay the clear bottoms of the kayaks were lighting up, like a million stars. Every stroke of the oars left a flurry of light in the water, and if you dragged your hands in the water, they would light up with these little firefly light creatures all around them. We tried to take some pictures, but it really just couldn’t do it justice. Gratefully it was almost completely dark, and so once our eyes became accustomed to the dark, it seemed like a really bright light show provided by mother nature. It’s shocking to think that at one point, the Spanish tried to block the inlet to the bay with stones, because there was a belief that the light was caused by the devil. Gratefully they weren’t too motivated and failed.

This morning we slept past 8 AM, woke up, made breakfast, and headed for the farmers market. Maybe the farmers weren’t able to make it to Costco yesterday, because the market wasn’t open today. That’s OK, we didn't need to buy much.

We drove into town and went to El Fortin de Conde Mirasol Museum. It was a replica of the last Spanish Fort built in the Caribbean, and contained a small, simple museum inside. As we walked around, it gave us opportunities to think about all the change that has happened on Vieques, much of which is the result of the US Navy using the island for a bombing range. It is interesting to think about what this place looked like 200 years ago. Unfortunately, more than half of the island is not accessible because of unexploded bombs.

We were close to Playa Bastimento, a beach we hadn't been to yet, so we decided to check it out. It was a really small simple beach in a neighborhood. We found a big palm tree and werr mostly by ourselves until two young families showed up. There was a tide pool right in front of us that was perfect for young children, as they couldn’t get washed out into the ocean. We imagined our grandchildren playing, and sat there for most of the rest of the morning and early afternoon. Eventually, it started raining lightly and we headed to another beach.

We drove to La Plata beach and nearly had the cove to ourselves. This beach is what you would imagine when you think of a Caribbean beach. It was sandy as far out as you could walk. More light rain arrived and drove us into our jeep, where Natalie read her book and I took a nap. Eventually we went back out on the beach for for a while, and then headed back to work on dinner and get ready to pick up Brent and Ann and family.

We made it back to the little town near our Airbnb in time to hit Lizzie‘s Lunchbox taco truck again. They were actually closed, but they were nice and let us be the last customers of the night and get four vegetarian tacos. We had bought these the first night we were here and loved them, and we were feeling the need for some vegetables in our diet. It was a great meal.

We went back to our Airbnb and took quick showers and then drove to the ferry to pick up Brent and Ann and their family. The logistics worked fine and we were able to take Brent, Ann,  and Ben (Emily’s boyfriend) up to their VRBO to pick up their jeeps, and then they went back to pick up the rest of their crew who were waiting near the ferry. They are traveling in a group of 10, and there was no chance they would all fit in our Jeep. It was good to see them, but we could tell they were tired. We can appreciate what it feels like to travel here on the red eye flight to Atlanta.

They are in an amazing house with a pool. We are kind of on the opposite extreme. It felt like we were splurging to eat out of a food trailer tonight.

In our Airbnb we have an electric hot water heater that is built into the showerhead. I’ve seen some people refer to these as the South American suicide shower, because it seems to them that electricity in a showerhead is an electric shock waiting to happen. However, thinking about the risks of putting a toxic gas in your house, gas that is also explosive, and using that to heat water, that seems crazy in comparison. I bet there are far more deaths from gas as the heater of water, after normalizing for use, than electric shower heads. Plus, using an electric heater at the point of need reduces their internal plumbing by 50%. They probably look at our set up and think we are nuts. It’s funny how the things we are used to seem safe and the things we are not used to seem crazy or dangerous.

In other news, out Jeep’s air conditioner has transformed itself into a heater. Gratefully, we can just roll down the windows. It’s amazing to think of those back home who are dealing with the cold right now, and I’m whining about my air conditioner not working.
