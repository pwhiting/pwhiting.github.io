We are both avid outdoor enthusiasts. We've spent much of our time together exploring the beautiful world. We love to hike, bike, climb, and explore. In 2017 we were began thinking about tandem bike touring. We had done several centuries on road bikes, but we ride at different rates. We wanted something that would keep us within talking distance. Also, I (pete) was starting to feel the effects of thousands of hours on road and mountain bikes - it was taking a toll on my back, wrists, and neck, to name a few... So we decided to go all in on the "weird ride" category and bought a recumbent tandem bike from Nazca, a small company in the Netherlands (the owners recently retired and disbanded the company - sad for us but happy for them.) The bike is the epitome of [slowcomotion](https://www.bbc.com/travel/columns/slowcomotion), but our bodies can tolerate long hours on it and we love seeing the world slowly. On a bike one can smell, hear, feel, and see things that are missed in a fast-moving car.

Here are our rides:
* [2017](/categories/2017): Amsterdam to Paris and back - we rode into Germany on the way to Paris and rode though Normandy and Dunkirk on the way back.

* [2019](/categories/2019): Sweden to Amsterdam - we rode to Copenhagen then to the top of Denmark, then to Amsterdam
* [2021](/categories/2021): Northwest corner of the US - we rode on the Trail of the Olympian and the Route of the Hiwatha on this ride
* [2022](/categories/2022): Katy trail in Missouri - we rode along a nearly 300 mile rail trail in the heart of our country
* [2023](/categories/2023): Paris to Frankfurt - we stuck to the EuroVelo routes for most of this ride, avoiding traffic and enjoying the beautiful French and German countrysides
* [2024](/categories/2024): Loop out of Geneva - we started in Geneva and rode to Lyon and then toward Strassburg before heading back to Geneva


Each ride is between 700 and 1000 miles in length and takes 2-3 weeks.
